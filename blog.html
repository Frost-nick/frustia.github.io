		<p> Most of this assignment was me trying to figure out how to link and make git, along with github up and working</p>

                <h1>All in all, my experience with this program is mostly me trying to figure out problems.</h1>
                <p> Mostly what I wanted to get off my chest was the fact that I didn't seem to have any clue how to troubleshoot with github classroom becuase even a TA I asked didn'tunderstand my problem</p>
                <p>I spent so much time trying to figure out how to connect my github classroom to my wsl in essence but I have spent a lot of time trying to fix this mistake and long process of trying to make my program workable</p>
		<p>The actual code that I wanted to type did not take me long to program at all but for some odd reason that even a TA, along with my classmates had no idea how to figure out and as soon as I changed my password, it worked </p>
		<p>I used so many sites that It would take a while to list them all trying to find a source that would tell me how to fix my problem. In the end, it got done, I did have a little help mostly in just how I started.</p>
		<p>Also the reason that I am formatting these sentences in the way that I am is mostly because it looks good in the code on my screen, Thank you for being my professor, and hope to have a great year with you. -Anthony Frusti</p>

		<h1>Code_blog_2</h1>
		<p>For the most part with this assignment, I have no excuse for not completing it fully other than the excuse that I was swamped during the week that I was gonna work on it.</p>
		<p>The reason that this project looks so awful is due to the fact that due to familial circumstances, as well as an emergency due to coronavirus.</p>
		<p> Some of the things that I did learn for this project is the importance of working through stress, as well as using the lectures to ensure that the code that I am using works</p>
		<p>This code is awful, does some of the work but not all of it, in the future will plan better, but hoenstly sorry for having to make you see this monstroisty. -Anthony Frusti</p>
