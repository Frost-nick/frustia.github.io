                <h1>All in all, my experience with this program is mostly me trying to figure out problems.</h1>
                <p> Mostly what I wanted to get off my chest was the fact that I didn't seem to have any clue how to troubleshoot with github classroom becuase even a TA I asked didn'tunderstand my problem</p>
                <p>I spent so much time trying to figure out how to connect my github classroom to my wsl in essence but I have spent a lot of time trying to fix this mistake and long process of trying to make my program workable</p>
